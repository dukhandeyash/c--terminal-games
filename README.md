# Multi-Game C++ Project: Snake and Ladders, Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman

This project is a collection of four classic games implemented in C++: **Snake and Ladders**, **Chess**, **Tic-Tac-Toe**, and **Hangman**. Each game is designed to provide an interactive and fun experience through the terminal/console interface.

## Games Included

1. **Snake and Ladders**  
   A simple dice-based game where players race to reach the final square, navigating through snakes and climbing ladders.

2. **Chess**  
   A two-player strategy game where players compete to checkmate the opponent's king.

3. **Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   A classic 3x3 grid game where two players aim to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

4. **Hangman**  
   A word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a word by suggesting letters before the man is "hanged."
